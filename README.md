# Grade Calculator

WEBSITE LINK: https://sgmalik.w3.uvm.edu/Grade-Calculator/gpa.php

- River Bumpas and Surya Malik
- No added installations
- Our program is a website that currently allows users to enter course grades and return a GPA. We are also working on a final grade calculator tab that we did not have time to fully implement for this Module
- Our program uses HTML, Javascript, PHP, CSS, and Python
- We used HTML and CSS to create the framework for our website. We then chose to use Javascript to add functionality to our webpage because our website needed to be dynamic so users could enter an unknown number of class grades. We then use PHP to take the data that is entered and send it to Python where the calculations occur, and then the result is sent back using PHP and displayed on the website. 
- We want to keep working on this website, and in the future we are looking to finish the Final Grade tab where the user will enter grades that they received on different assignments and then the website will present them with the final grade they will earn in the course based off of the weights that the user enters.
- There are no known bugs at the time of submission, but the Final Grade tab is not functional at the time of submission
