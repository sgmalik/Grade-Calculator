- This repo is a collection of files I used to create a final grade and GPA calculator website, hosted on a server provided by my University. It utilizes an HTML, CSS, and Javascript frontend, with dynamic form elements created through event listeners in Javascript. Once the user submits the form of their choosing, the data is parsed in a PHP file (depending on the form that was submitted), formatted, and sent to a .txt file. This .txt file is passed to a Python script using command line arguments which performs the grade/GPA calculation and returns this to PHP which outputs on the webpage. This was my first stab at using Javascript and has motivated me to continue experimenting with Javascript and the vast libraries and frameworks within it. The development process was very fascinating and inspired me to create more of these independent projects in the future.
